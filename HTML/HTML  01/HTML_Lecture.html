<!-- Lecture-01: Html its tags and attributes -->
 <!-- 

 As much Html tags as possible and how to use attributes 

 -->


<!-- Tags in html -->
<!-- HTML tags are small commands that instruct browsers on how to interpret and display the content of a web page.  -->



<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- !Doctype means its written in Html 5 -->
<!-- Browsers are Idiots so they dont understand its html 5 just if you say -->
<!-- 

Fun fact

In older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration is more complicated because the declaration must refer to a DTD (Document Type Definition).

HTML 4.01:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
XHTML 1.1:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

-->
<html lang="en">

<!-- Start of Html code and lang="en" means its English code -->

<!-- Head is for metadata  -->
<!-- Seo depends on meta data -->
<!-- Better metadata means it'll rank higher on search -->
